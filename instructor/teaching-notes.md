| Teachers don't Teach                                  | They show them and throw them into the pool, similar to how one's really learn how to ride a bike | https://youtu.be/vrU6YJle6Q4?t=440 ![](../static/img/2022-05-02-14-48-35.png)  |
| Teachers should be able to receive and trust students | Like receiving an apple and trust them.                                                           |                                                                                |

| Understands that they have life outside of school     | Teachers notice when they see that they have a struggle, you need to listen                       |                                                                                |


[Becoming a Better Teacher](https://youtu.be/fdZkmbY0HB0)      

1. Get in the eye level -> Why are they learning this? -> It can be explained in simple terms.
2. Be your unique teacher -> Is more about how you learn.
3. Learning occurs withouth Teaching -> We don't give a baby some pointers into walking, is more about error and trial.

## Asian Teaching vs Western Teaching

What are things that matter? How much discipline should I provide them with?
- Searching for sets of exercises outside of Whizara because it is just so bad.



## Notes form my perosnal experience

- You need to encourage their friedns to ask.
- even if it is the same question -> They should be able to retell that.



### Questions

- How do I get to have that `earned respect item`?
- Is showing instead of asking a good idea?


## Games and Just for Fun Projects
*Lets create some games for the kids to play! Maybe...*

Games that you can create
- Cute Tik Tak Toe
- Cute Pacman like
- Cute Platformer like
- Pass the butter.
- Speed car game


:::tip

And have them printing the commands int he terminal e.g.

- when fighting and lose health you press on the `health += 1`
- `character = "Melissa"`
- Or when receiving `inputs`

You just have some comments on it.
