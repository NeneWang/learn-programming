- If signal is `3` it prints: `Keep driving`

🙋‍♀️ Sample expected program:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/java/fa526d2828?toggleCode=true" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

***

(i) What happens if any number other than 1, 2 and 3 is entered? Action in the else block will be executed.

<RadioListAns checkList={["It will throw an error", "Action in the else block will be executed.", "Nothing will happen"]} answer={2} >
</RadioListAns>

(ii) Is there a way to ensure that an action (to drive / slow down / stop) is taken only if numbers 3, 2, or 1 are entered?

<RadioListAns checkList={["Adding another else if statement to check if signal == 3 would ensure this.", "Thats impossible.", "Wait what"]} answer={1} >
</RadioListAns>

(iii) How can you notify the user if an invald input is entered?

<RadioListAns checkList={["Adding another else if statement to check if signal == 3 would ensure this.", "Thats impossible.", "Once we have considered all the 3 valid conditions using if..else if (in (ii) above), the else block can be used to notify the user if none of the expected values for n are entered, as shown below."]} answer={3} >
</RadioListAns>
