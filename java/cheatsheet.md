| User input       | A feature in programming languages that allows users to provide the inputs for a program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Prompt           | A symbol or some text from a program indicating that it is waiting for an input from the user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Test             | The process of finding how well your code works by providing different inputs to the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Reusability      | Quality of the code that allows it to be reused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Logical Error    | A logical error is a bug in a program that causes it to produce wrong or unintended result. However, the program compiles and runs without showing an error on the console. <br/> `Example: divided by ZERO, when an integer is divided by ZERO then it will                  compile successfully but at runtime, it will throw an error.` |
| Syntax error     | Syntax errors are mistakes that a developer/user can do while writing the code. <br/>  `       Example: System.out.Print(“Good morning!”) - In this line of code, alphabet p in print() has           been capitalized, resulting in a syntax error.`                                                                                       |

| shape()          | shape() method is used change the shape of the turtle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Builtin function | Pre-defined blocks of code that perform a specific function. Example - input(), print(), min(), max().                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
