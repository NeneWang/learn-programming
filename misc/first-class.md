## Introducing ourselves
Hello I am Nelson I will be your instructor for programming and your success is
my #1 priority!

As a way to get to know each other, I will ask everyone to introduce themselves
by answering the following questions:
- What is your name?
- If you could only use one word to represent yourself, what word would that be?
  (Optional: say why)
- Also why are you here?




## Warm-up Exercise

*This is just to get a feeling of the level of the class, please don't worry if
you can't finish the assigment! Also feel free to ask anything and as many times
as you need to about any question you have regarding the prioblem, how to solve it, etc!*


:::tip Problem prompt
Create a program to help you introduce yourself using the following template
```
Hello I am [your name] and my mood word would be [your word]. I am here because [reason you are here]
```
Example
```
Hello I am Nelson and my mood word would be curious. I am here because I love teaching about what I am passionated about.
```

:::tip Bonus point challange 1: Using Variables
Save your [name], [mood word], and the [reason you are here] into variables instead of
hardcoding it when you are printing it. And then figure out how to print them in
a way it shows the same result as before!

Click here for an example in how to format variables into variables

:::tip Bonus point challange 2: Prompting for user input
Now make the program ask your for your [name], [mood word], and the [reason you
are here], save those inputs into variables, and then print them using the
same template as in the problems above!
## TODO create the gif image.
