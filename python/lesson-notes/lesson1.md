In python libraries are a collection of modules, containing code that can be

### Analogy

Suppose you have a set of questions about Biology, I don't know much about
biology, so Ideally I would like to invite (import) a biology teacher to our
class so you can ask him biology questions.


```python
#The biology teacher library probably doesn't exist, but this is just to show how this would it would translate in code
import biology_teacher
# We invite our biology teacher to the room

biology_teacher.askBiologyQuestion("Can I turn my cat into diamond?")
# and now we are asking our biology teacher a biology related question


```

**Why is it useful?**
Is useful to have libraries as a way to get access to precreated code that can
help us accelerate our programming (so we can focus on creating what we want
instead of the details of something)
