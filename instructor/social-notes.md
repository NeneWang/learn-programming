## Inspiration

:::tip I just hope they can learn something
I am their #6 Instructor. I love programming, and I program in an almost religious manner. It just breaks my heart seeying this kids not being able to learn this thing I feel so passionate about, because they just had bad instructors, it really breaks my heart and I hope I can teach something to this kids by the end of the semester.

### Histories
- I had one kid going beyond and above after going for him, he even printed 6 faces! that made me so happy
- I had one student shaking his hand when trying to code because he was trying to contain his laughter
- Also I had a student going above and beyond trying to create his own coins and making Sanic go around and try to collect them. 
- You know that feeling? It just melt my heart!
