The BooleanExpression is tested, and if it is true, the Statement is executed. Then, the BooleanExpression is tested again. If it is true, the Statement is executed. This cycle repeats until the BooleanExpression is false.

### While Loop


```java
import java.util.*;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int number = 0;
    while (number<5)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello");
        number++;
    }
    
  }
}
```
