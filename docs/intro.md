## Why a website?

Hello everyone, I will be posting my "slides" om this website. The reason I am
choosing a website, instead of using traditional slides, is because I can
quickly update the website, and allow everyone to find the website with a quick
google search! Also because I am planning to create interactive visualizations
to help everyone grasp the concept faster!
