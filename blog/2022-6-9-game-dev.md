### Escalability

This means how good are they at scaling up.

### Out of the question

- 3djs -> Too complex for your first game engine


## Gamemaker Studio 2 - For first game engine

:::caution There is a catch!

It is free to develop games, you have to pay for exporting it (Sharing to friends)

**However**
- As an instructor I can buy and export the games for you and just send you the files or publish them for you
- Of course I will not take any credits/profit form your game

:::note Why GameMaker Studio 2

- Easy to learn
- Decent Scalability
- Compatibility with all type of platforms: Web browsers, Mobile Applications,

## Phaser/Godot- Best for Chromebook

While the case for Phaser is that it just needs a linux terminal + a programming field and that should be enough since it just needs a browser for loading it.
