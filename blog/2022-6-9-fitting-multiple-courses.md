title: Fitting Multiple Classess in one.
---

## Idea: What if I run out of things to teach? I can teach multiple things that the students might be williing to learn.

**Reasoning**
Usually my "lecture" takes around 5 minutes. The rest of the class is left for students to work on the activity


## Strategy

- Separate the lesson of 45 minutes in order to fit multiple lectures. 
- Separate the different lessons  the further apart from each other so it's not a "lump" of information
