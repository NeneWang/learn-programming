## Learning the secret of wealth: Compound Interest
This might be a concept harder to understand but here we have a program that approximates how rich you will be if you start investing in the stock market

```python
age_start_investing = 18
age_retirement = 60
# In percentages: 1.08 would be 8% interest
initial_investment = 1000
expected_yearly_interestgain = 1.08

worth_end =  1.08**(age_retirement - age_start_investing)
print("Your profits Margin is:")
# Write your code below
print("At age of 60 your $1000 will be:" + str(initial_investment*worth_end))

```

:::tip Fix the following speed printer
The following program doesn't follow the formula properly please fix it (it should print `32` when `v1 = 2`, `aceleration = 3` and `time = 10`)
```python
initial_velocity =  2
aceleration = 3
time_elapsed = 10

print("Velocity of the object at time: "+ str(time_elapsed))
print(initial_velocity + aceleration)
```
