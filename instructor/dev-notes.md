### Activity Example
:::tip Activity Hiking ⛰

Pete and Shannon are hiking. Shannon is always 2 miles ahead of Pete. What is the distance Shannon has covered if Pete has covered 10 miles? How would the program change if Shannon has covered twice as much distance as Pete?
The output should look something like this:
```
If Shannon is two miles ahead of Pete, distance hiked by Shannon is 12 miles

If Shannon covers twice as much distance as Pete, distance travelled by Shannon is 20 miles
```
