:::tip Exercise: Create the following

- If signal is `1` it prints: `Stop your vehicle`
- If signal is `2` it prints `Slow down and bring the vehicle to a stop`
- If signal is `3` it prints: `Keep driving`

(i) What happens if any number other than 1, 2 and 3 is entered? Action in the else block will be executed.

<RadioListAns checkList={["It will throw an error", "Action in the else block will be executed.", "Nothing will happen"]} answer={2} >
</RadioListAns>

(ii) Is there a way to ensure that an action (to drive / slow down / stop) is taken only if numbers 3, 2, or 1 are entered?

<RadioListAns checkList={["Adding another else if statement to check if signal == 3 would ensure this.", "Thats impossible.", "Wait what"]} answer={1} >
</RadioListAns>

(iii) How can you notify the user if an invald input is entered?

<RadioListAns checkList={["Adding another else if statement to check if signal == 3 would ensure this.", "Thats impossible.", "Once we have considered all the 3 valid conditions using if..else if (in (ii) above), the else block can be used to notify the user if none of the expected values for n are entered, as shown below."]} answer={3} >
</RadioListAns>

## Automatic Water Sprinkler

Smart Sprinkler: You want to design a smart sprinkler that decides when to water the yard so as to minimize the use of water. Here are some conditions that determine whether or not your yard needs to be watered:

- If the temperature is over 90 degrees and it has not rained today

- If the temperature is between 70 and 90 degrees and it has not rained in the last 2 days.

- If the temperature is below 70 degrees and it has not rained in the last 3 days.

Take user input for today's temperature, days since it last rained. Based on the user's inputs, your program for the smart sprinkler should output whether or not the smart sprinkler should water the yard today.
