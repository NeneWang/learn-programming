🚀 What is Among Us? 
</summary>
Among Us is essentially an online multiplayer version of the party game wink murder, but set on a constantly malfunctioning spaceship.  you’re told whether you’re an <b>innocent crew member</b> or an <b>imposter</b>. 

Allowed to talk to each other for a limited time. During these discussions, the crew needs to try to work out the identity of the imposter(s) by reporting on which other players seem to have been <b>acting suspiciously</b> [^1]

- Write in the chat your defense to convince the fleet that you are **not the impostor**!

- Try entering nothing -> It should just print `you: ` and not have the chat react
