:::note While Loop

![](../../static/img/2022-06-07-22-46-00.png)

The BooleanExpression is tested, and if it is true, the Statement is executed. Then, the BooleanExpression is tested again. If it is true, the Statement is executed. This cycle repeats until the BooleanExpression is false.

:::


```java
while (BooleanExpression)
{
    System.out.println("Hello");
    number++;
}
```
